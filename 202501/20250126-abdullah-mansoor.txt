Goal of the Article

This guide helps readers effectively use stacked ensembles. It shows simplified use of stacked ensemble models with H2O for practical regression and classification tasks.


Problem It Is Solving
- Explain stacked ensembles.
- Show H2O implementation.
- Demonstrate tuning.

Key Concepts
1. Stacked Ensembles:** Combining base model predictions.
2. Base Models: Examples like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest.
3. Meta-Learner: Role and options like linear regression.
4. Tuning:** Using H2O Grid Search.
5. Applications: Real-world tasks and evaluations.
